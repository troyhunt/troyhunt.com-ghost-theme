# I run this site for free and rely on community goodwill. By all means, if you find an *actual*
# security vulnerability then contact me and tell me what it is. If you'd like, encrypt your
# message using the key from my Keybase account listed above. If you find something awesome then
# I'd love to send you some stickers and a personally 3D printed Have I Been Pwned logo. But if
# you've just run some automated tooling, found something trivial then reached out with the
# expectation of cashing in, you're going to be disappointed.
